# DSGA-1007-SegregationModel
## How segregation formed? -Simulation of Schelling's model of segregation.

Schelling's model of segregation is a classic example of agent-based model developed by economist Thomas Schelling in 2010. By simulation settlement and migration of different groups of agents, the model shows that even without external factors, people's in-group preference may lead different groups tends to becoming more segregated.

### Model Description
The model is set in a n$\times$n grid, where each point means a space for agents to occupy. Only one agent can occupy one space at a time.
Agents will be split into two or more groups. The initial distribution of agents is random. Since we suppose agents have preference towards their own group, they may choose to relocate if the fraction is not high enough.
